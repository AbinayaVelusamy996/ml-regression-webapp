Title: ML Regression Web App (Flask/Django)
Objective
Build a web application using Flask or Django that trains multiple regression models, allows users to make predictions, and compares which model performs best.
Requirements
1. Framework
Choose either Flask or Django.
2. Dataset
Use any numeric dataset (examples: sales, weather, energy, etc.).
3. Models (Minimum 5)
Train at least five regression models. Examples include (you may add others too):
Linear Regression
Ridge / Lasso
Polynomial Regression
ElasticNet
SGD Regressor
Calculate the following metrics:
MAE
MSE
RMSE
R²
4. Web Pages
Home Page
Project introduction
Dataset information
Prediction Page
Dropdown to select a model
Input fields with min/max range info
Display prediction result
Model Comparison Page
Show performance metrics of all models
Highlight the best-performing model
Include at least one performance chart (e.g., Matplotlib)
